# DS4D-PA-X
This is a project related to the PA-X peace agreement database.

## DESIGN
Who is your audience? Do you know enough about them? Would they be appealed by your solution?

The audience of our project is someone working in the field of politics (such as politician) or interested in the peace agreements and history. 
For some professionals, they engage in political activity as a profession and engages in political speculation and political power in order to meet the political needs of the group or individual. For them, it is difficult to find anything other than the peace agreement in the original data of PAX. Pax only provides the content and basic information of this treaty, such as the time of signing, agreement stage, etc. There is no way for these data to reflect it directly from the data, nor is there a way to understand what happened at this stage and what impact it had, so for politicians, just PAX database is not enough.
For some unprofessionals, the pdf version of the peace agreement text is very difficult to read, and the encoded data only contains whether it mentions the issue or not, or some of agreements shows which degree the issue is (1/2/3). Therefore, these are not interesting for non-professionals, it is difficult to find useful information from the original data, and some technical terms are difficult to understand.



What is your overall take-home message?

What are the findings and facts you want to present to them?

what do they need to know (about the data or analysis) to understand your points?

What is your data holders' main question? Can your solution answer it?
How will your work be displayed to the audience?

Why were you interested in data in the first place? This can help you finding a solution you like and clarify why the data is important (if it's important to you for some reason, it will be for others, too).

## TEAM WORK
Overall, our solution is quite good. We realised main functions of our website whose goal is to let our audience explore peace agreements with different issues in different countries, and its relationship with different world development indicators. 

Our team has Javascript and D3. Js programming skills. For one thing, we coded to realise data visualisation. For another thing, we effectively imported large amounts of data from one database and also combined with other databases quickly.  Besides, our team has the ability of computer graphics, which means we used Photoshop and Illustrator to draw interesting comics for the website and presentation slides. In addition, our team members are good at drawing pictures and hand-making, so we created a flip book to show why the peace issue is raised, how the peace agreement is made, what the worldwide development of peace agreements looks like.

Each member in the team has clear responsibilities. Weekly tasks were assigned to each member, and we had a group meeting at the ending of every week to talk about project progress and challenges. We worked independently. But if someone had problems when doing tasks, we put forward issues on the Gitlab, had a discussion withe members, and efficiently solved problems.
