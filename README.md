## DESIGN
Who is your audience? Do you know enough about them? Would they be appealed by your solution?

What is your overall take-home message?

What are the findings and facts you want to present to them?

what do they need to know (about the data or analysis) to understand your points?

What is your data holders' main question? Can your solution answer it?
How will your work be displayed to the audience?

Why were you interested in data in the first place? This can help you finding a solution you like and clarify why the data is important (if it's important to you for some reason, it will be for others, too).

Each of us have clear responsibilities
