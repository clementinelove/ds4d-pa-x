# DS4D-PA-X
This is a project related to the PA-X peace agreement database.

## DESIGN
Who is your audience? Do you know enough about them? Would they be appealed by your solution?

What is your overall take-home message?

What are the findings and facts you want to present to them?

what do they need to know (about the data or analysis) to understand your points?

What is your data holders' main question? Can your solution answer it?
How will your work be displayed to the audience?

Why were you interested in data in the first place? This can help you finding a solution you like and clarify why the data is important (if it's important to you for some reason, it will be for others, too).

## TEAM WORK
Overall, our solution is quite good. We realised main functions of our website whose goal is to let our audience explore peace agreements with different issues in different countries, and its relationship with different world development indicators. 

Our team has Javascript and D3. Js programming skills. For one thing, we can code to realise data visualisation. For another thing, we can effectively import large amounts of data from one database and also merge other databases quickly.  Besides, our team has the ability of computer graphics, which means we use Photoshop and Illustrator to draw interesting comics for the website and presentation slides. In addition, our team members are good at drawing pictures and hand-making, so it is helpful to create a flip book to show why the peace issue is raised, how the peace agreement is made, what the worldwide development of peace agreements looks like.

Each member in the team has clear responsibilities. Weekly tasks were assigned to each member, and we have a group meeting at the ending of every week to talk about project progress and challenges. Besides, we can work independently. If someone has problems when doing tasks, we can put forward issues on the Gitlab, have a discussion withe members, and efficiently solve problems.
