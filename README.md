# DS4D-PA-X
This is a project related to the PA-X peace agreement database.

## DESIGN
Who is your audience? Do you know enough about them? Would they be appealed by your solution?

What is your overall take-home message?

What are the findings and facts you want to present to them?

what do they need to know (about the data or analysis) to understand your points?

What is your data holders' main question? Can your solution answer it?
How will your work be displayed to the audience?

Why were you interested in data in the first place? This can help you finding a solution you like and clarify why the data is important (if it's important to you for some reason, it will be for others, too).

## TEAM WORK
Overall, our solution is quite good. We realised main functions of our website whose goal is to let our audience explore peace agreements with different issues in different countries, and its relationship with different world development indicators. 

Our team has Javascript and D3. Js programming skills. For one thing, we coded to realise data visualisation. For another thing, we effectively imported large amounts of data from one database and also combined with other databases quickly.  Besides, our team has the ability of computer graphics, which means we used Photoshop and Illustrator to draw interesting comics for the website and presentation slides. In addition, our team members are good at drawing pictures and hand-making, so we created a flip book to show why the peace issue is raised, how the peace agreement is made, what the worldwide development of peace agreements looks like.

Each member in the team has clear responsibilities. Weekly tasks were assigned to each member, and we had a group meeting at the ending of every week to talk about project progress and challenges. We worked independently. But if someone had problems when doing tasks, we put forward issues on the Gitlab, had a discussion withe members, and efficiently solved problems.


REPORT:::
The PA-X Peace Agreement Database (www.peaceagreements.org) is a database that contains more than 1700 peace agreements, and it provides a comprehensive dataset of peace agreements from 1990 to 2019, it can be used for both quantitative and qualitative research. What’s more, it enables people to disaggregate the data by country, entity, region, conflict type, and stage of agreement, and search a group of agreements, and it allows examination of different combinations of issues addressed. 

In PA-X, there are over 200 variables, such as human rights, economic power sharing and so on. In original data, for each peace agreement, there have data indicating whether it contains each variable, for example, speaking of human rights framework, this variable accounts for any provisions aiming to establish a human rights framework to guide the post-conflict period, e.g. by making provision for a bill of rights or for incorporation of human rights standards. If no such provisions appear in the agreement, the value on this variable is 0. When these provisions are found in the agreement, they are coded as follows:
1 = rhetorical provisions or mention of a human rights framework
2 = substantive provisions concerning a human rights framework
3 = detailed provisions for a human rights framework, indicating commitment.
So, it is hard to explore what detailed information behind the agreement. For example, there is a peace agreement mentioned about refugees in one country, but there are no extra data , such as the number of refugees, where did refugees come from. For example, one agreement is related to refugees, but we can’t directly know the impact of this agreement on refugees, and what other events happened during that period affected refugees, or the impact of agreements on other elements of this country. 

The audience of our project is someone working in the field of politics (such as politician) or interested in the peace agreements and history. For some professionals, they engage in political activity as a profession and engages in political speculation and political power in order to meet the political needs of the group or individual. For them, it is difficult to find anything other than the peace agreement in the original data of PAX. Pax only provides the content and basic information of this treaty, such as the time of signing, agreement stage, etc. There is no way for these data to reflect it directly from the data, nor is there a way to understand what happened at this stage and what impact it had, so for politicians, just PAX database is not enough. For some non-professionals, the pdf version of the peace agreement text is very difficult to read, and the encoded data only contains whether it mentions the issue or not, or some of agreements shows which degree the issue is (0/1/2/3). Therefore, these are not interesting for non-professionals, it is difficult to find useful information from the original data, and some technical terms are difficult to understand. 

Based on the database provided and the visualization project of last year, the data holder hopes to discover some things people might never thought about, and using a storytelling method, combined with illustrative timeline or map, to display a country's peace agreements.
In order to solve these challenges, we combined our database with World Economics and Politics Dataverse (https://ncgg.princeton.edu/wep/dataverse.html), which concludes UCDP Armed Conflict dataset, global financial development database, 885 total variables include GDP, GINI index, estimate of annual battle fatalities. By combining with an external database, we can find more information under each peace agreement-related variable. For example, we can see if the agreement has an effect on the GDP of that period, or can choose the exact data, like the total population, World Development Indicators, etc. By comparing directly with the peace agreement of this period, professional politicians and non-professionals can find more useful information.

However, our website is based on a timeline and uses one country to display data, we lack a summary of the entire data set, so we decided to use flipbook to display our overall data, which is Data visualization of the trend of peace agreements over time. As for the flipbook, its appearance is similar to the physical peace agreement, also it can show the changes in the data. Moreover It can also use funny comics to introduce the agreement signing process to everyone.
